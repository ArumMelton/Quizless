# Quizless

An interactive Coding Quiz
Coded by Arum Melton

Overview:

Quizless is an interactive coding quiz that allows the user to start a quiz, which simultaneously starts a timer. The quiz includes five coding questions that the user is required to answer in 75 seconds or less. The user is penalized 10 seconds for incorrect answers. When the user finishes the quiz or time runs out, the app brings you to a page to enter your initials. Scores are then displayed on the following page along with the initials submitted by the user. Enjoy!

User Story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

Challenges:
One of the biggest challenges that I faced developing this app was truly understanding how to connect everything together. Understanding the concept of flow in code was a big part of this for me.
